                          The strands are unlaid right down to the turns of the seizings, against which the crown is
                          formed as close as possible. The wall is then made under it and hauled taut, thus

                            may be made either as a standing or a running knot, according to whether it is to be
                            fixed to an end or a bight, or is to be formed round another part of rope or a post or

                              the ends are followed round a third or fourth time. To make the Manrope knot, whip
                              the rope at a distance of not less than 25 times the diameter of the rope, unlay the
                              strands to the whipping, and whip the ends. Make a wall and crown knot, keeping
                              the knot fairly loose. Then take each strand and follow its own part until three parts
                              have been made. Haul all parts taut and cut off the ends where they protrude from
                              the base of the knot.</p>

                              fitting, allowing two lengths to hang on the right and one on the left (i). Take the furthest

                              ends. The whipping may then be covered with a Turks Head.

                                <p>There are a number of different types of Sennit, the most popular being a Portuguese
                                  Sennit, which can be made flat, spiral or a combination of both. (This type of decorative
                                  ropework is very popular for covering belts and making light pull cords).
                                </p>
                                <p>There are only two working strands, which sit either side of a central heart, which could
                                  be a number of strands, usually two or three, or a single core (rope or a belt).
                                </p>
                                <p>To start the sennit the left hand strand is passed under the heart and over the right hand
                                  strand, a bight being retained on the left (i). The right hand strand is brought across, over
                                  the heart, down through the bight (ii), and both ends are drawn tight (iii).
                                  Having completed the first tuck of each working strand, if a spiral is required repeat the
                                  process commencing with the looping of the left hand strand as at the start. After a
                                  number of tucks a spiral will clearly be formed.
                                </p>
                                <p>The spiral can be reversed by commencing with the right hand strand being passed
                                  under the heart and over the left hand strand, a bight being retained on the right. The left
                                  hand strand is brought across, over the heart, down through the bight and both ends
                                  drawn tight.
                                </p>
                                <p>To ensure a Flat Sennit, complete the first series of tucks and draw tight. Having
                                  commenced with the left hand strand making the loop, now make a loop with the right
                                  hand strand, pass the left hand strand over the heart, down through the bight and draw
                                  tight. Continue to alternate the tucks left and right.
                                </p>
                                <p>The sennit may be completed by whipping or heat sealing the ends or by tucking back
                                  on itself and trimming the ends.

                                <p>Coachwhipping is a covering based on the square sennit. The most common method is
                                  to use eight strands, formed by attaching four strands at their mid points to the fitting to
                                  be covered, by a means of a twine seizing. This will provide eight strands, four above
                                  and four below the seizing.
                                </p>
                                <p>Take the four above down and to the right of the seizing, whilst the four below are taken
                                  to the left.
                                </p>
                                <p>Then take the strand furthest to the right round the back of the fitting, returning to the
                                  front between the second and third strands from the left, leaving the worked strand as
                                  the new fourth strand from the right at the finish.
                                </p>
                                <p>Then take the strand furthest to the left round the back of the fitting, returning to the front
                                  between the second and third strands from the right, leaving the worked strand as the
                                  new fourth strand from the left at the finish.
                                </p>
                                <p>The previous two stages are then repeated until the desired length of covering is
                                  achieved, finishing with another twine seizing around all eight strands and the fitting.
                                  This gives a finished appearance of four lengthwise rows of herringboning along the
                                  covering.
                                </p>
                                <p>Both ends would often be covered with Turk’s Heads to hide the seizings and cut ends.</p>
